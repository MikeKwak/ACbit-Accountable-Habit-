# Accountable Habits | Progress Monitoring Social Web App 
_June 2023 – Sep. 2023_

## Overview
Accountable Habits is a cutting-edge web application designed to keep track of personal goals and monitor progress in a collaborative manner. In today's bustling world, staying consistent and accountable for one's objectives is essential, and what better way to do it than with the help of our peers. This app emerged from a personal need and strategy my friend and I had been following – to share and brief each other on our weekly goals using Instagram. However, the fleeting nature of social media conversations made it challenging to retain and review our shared objectives.

## Motivation
While sharing our aspirations and progress on Instagram had its charm, the platform wasn't conducive to revisiting our historical records. Messages would get buried, making it challenging to gauge our trajectory and accomplishments. Thus, Accountable Habits was born - to offer users the affirmation and insight that they're on the right path.

## Key Features:
- **Responsive Dashboard**: Crafted using D3.js, the dashboard offers an intuitive data visualization experience tailored to goal tracking.
- **Real-time Interactions**: The app boasts a real-time chat and notification system using Socket.IO, ensuring instant feedback and improved user engagement.
- **Infinite Scrolling**: For an uninterrupted browsing experience and optimized network performance.
- **Context-Aware Command System**: The Chrono library aids in understanding the nuances of subjective timeline inputs via natural language processing.
- **Back-End Excellence**: RESTful APIs meticulously designed with TypeScript and Node.js, backed by the robustness of an AWS EC2 deployment.
